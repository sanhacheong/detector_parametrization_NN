# Detector Parametrization using Neural Networks

This repository demonstrates some examples of using Neural Networks (NN's) to parametrize the response characteristics of detectors in physics experiments.

## Environment Set-up

Below is the Python and some package versions used to demonstrate the examples shown and write the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository. While other versions might run the Notebooks without any errors and produce consistent results, these are not guaranteed.

```
  python 3.6.7
  jupyter 1.0.0
  jupyterlab 0.35.6
  numpy 1.16.4
  scipy 1.3.0
  matplotlib 3.1.0
  keras 2.2.4
  tensorflow 1.3.0
```
